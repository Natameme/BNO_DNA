# LiveCoding
2-credit course which counts towards Creative Coding Minor.
LMSC-261 is a prerequisite.

## Description
In this course, students develop programming skills to use their computers as dynamic musical instruments in solo and ensemble settings. As live coders, students will create and modify original code for audio application to respond to the needs of a particular performance in real time. Emphasis is placed on developing software instruments and environments. Topics include: web-based live coding; pattern-based + algorithmic composition; manipulation of audio samples; networked collective composition; structures/forms for live coding improvisation; and performance displays and visuals. The course culminates in a concert where students play original works using their own customized software instruments. Upon completion of the course, 'laptop' will be a secondary instrument with which students have competency.

## Technology Requirements

## Assignments and Grading

Description|Grade
---|---:|
Attendance and Participation|20%
Group project|15%
Presentation|20%
Solo performance|15%
Large Project|30%
**Total**|**100%**

**Attendance and Participation**
- Each week that you thoughtfully contribute to the class will count towards roughly 2% of your final grade. If you need to be absent you must email me *before* class for me to give you partial credit (or submit a drs note after).
- You are allowed one unexcused absence or two excused absences without penalty.
- If you are absent you are responsible for the materials of the class you missed. I will not catch you up over email, but you may ask me questions during my office hour *after* you have reviewed the materials.

**Group Project**
- 5-10 min. MiniTidal set co-developed with 2-3 of your classmates
- Documentation for submission: code, a .md documentation file (see below) that also addresses how your group worked together.

**Presentation**
- 10 min. presentation on a LiveCoding topic or work of your choice (with instructor preapproval)
- Documentation for submission: .md bibliography

**Solo performance**
- 5 min. LiveCoding solo performance for the class (and/or broadcast livestream)
- Documentation for submission: program note, code, documentation file (see below)

**Large Project**
- Solo-authored composition for the entire group OR original/DIY SC class
- Can be done in SuperCollider, PD, C sound, ChucK, TidalCycles, Python, C++, and C but use of other languages and/or in conjunction with other softwares must have instructor preapproval.
- Documentation for submission: program note if applicable a composition, code, documentation file (see below)

### Documentation files (written as a .md file in your dedicated GitHub repository) must have the following:
  - what you did
  - how you did it
  - the problems you faced
  - how you overcame them
  - *what code you used from others/elsewhere*
    - where to find that code
